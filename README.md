# SmartWebCrawler - Unfinished
Simple web crawler that locates a user-selected element on a web site with frequently changing information. You regularly face an issue that the crawler fails to find the element after minor page updates. After some analysis you decided to make your analyzer tolerant to minor website changes so that you donâ€™t have to update the code every time.
